# AQI_Tests

These are a series of statistical tests and evaluations I undertook on a dataset of AQI (Air Quality Index) for states and counties in the USA. 
The targets for the tests were:

**Confidence Intervals**
1. Provides a summary of the mean AQI for the states.
2. Construct a boxplot visualization for AQI of these states using seaborn.
3. Evaluate which state(s) may be most affected by a policy which targets low air quality, based on the data and a boxplot visualisation.
4. Construct a confidence interval for the state with the highest mean AQI

**Exploring Sampling Methods**
1. effective sampling of a dataset in order to make it easier to analyse
2. analyse data on air quality with respect to carbon monoxide—a major air pollutant—and report findings.

**Hypothesis Testing**
1. Within California, if the mean AQI in Los Angeles County is statistically different from the rest of California.
2. Does New York have a lower AQI than Ohio?
3. A new policy will affect those states with a mean AQI of 10 or greater. Can you rule out Michigan from being affected by this new policy?
